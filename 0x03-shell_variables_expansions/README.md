## 0-alias

This script creates a shell alias:

```bash
alias ls='rm *'
```

**Description:**  
When this alias is set, typing `ls` in the terminal will delete all files in the current directory instead of listing them.

**Warning:**  
This is a dangerous alias and can cause loss of data. Use only for educational purposes and with extreme caution.
